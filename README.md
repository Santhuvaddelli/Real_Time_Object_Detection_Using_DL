# Real-Time Object Detection Using Deep Learning 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time object detection using deep learning techniques, specifically with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models. The system can detect objects from a custom or standard dataset live from a webcam feed or video stream , image and video.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- Google Colab (for training models)
- Ultralytics
